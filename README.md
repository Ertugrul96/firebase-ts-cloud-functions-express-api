# Project Vision and Architectural Focus
I initiated this project to demonstrate robust expertise in building a highly scalable Serverless Social Media API using TypeScript. The core objective was to showcase proficiency in NoSQL data modeling within Firestore and implement a strong event-driven architecture.

My key development goals included:

Data Consistency: Proving my ability to manage complex, relational data effectively within a NoSQL (Firestore) environment, complementing my experience in traditional SQL/PostgreSQL systems.

Event-Driven Design: Leveraging Cloud Functions Triggers to ensure the application automatically responds to complex events (likes, follows) in real-time.

Scalability: Structuring the entire microservice foundation for seamless integration with high-performance tools like Kafka and Redis.

# Key Capabilities & Technology Stack
This solution exemplifies a best-practices approach to Serverless development, highlighting key technical strengths:

Platform & Serverless: Firebase Cloud Functions (2nd Gen)—Mastery of scalable, cloud-native backend deployment.

Database: Cloud Firestore—Demonstrates expertise in advanced NoSQL Data Modeling and indexing for large-scale social network relationships.

Language: TypeScript—Utilized throughout the codebase to guarantee type safety, maintainability, and enterprise-level reliability.

Asynchronous Processing: The event-driven nature (using Firestore triggers) confirms a strong understanding of patterns highly compatible with Kafka for resilient microservice communication.

Performance: The architecture is intentionally designed for future integration with Redis to handle high-speed caching of frequently accessed data.

# Functional Architecture and Data Consistency
I engineered the following critical workflows using Firestore triggers and dedicated functions to ensure data consistency and real-time user experience:

User Feed Management: Functions were implemented to update user feeds instantly when they follow or un-follow another user.

Real-time Notifications: Developed systems to automatically update the user's Events collection and send notifications when their posts receive a like or comment.

Data Denormalization & Integrity: Created logic to automatically and consistently update denormalized data (e.g., user profiles) across all related collections (posts, comments) when a user changes their profile information.

# Justification of Technology Choices
Why Firestore?
I chose Firestore for its inherent NoSQL flexibility and its support for real-time listeners, which are crucial for a social application. This approach contrasts with, and complements, my experience in SQL systems by focusing on high-read performance and horizontal scaling necessary for dynamic web services.

Why TypeScript?
TypeScript was non-negotiable for this project. Given the complexity of the serverless triggers and data manipulation, TypeScript's strong typing guarantees reliability and prevents runtime errors. This ensures a clean, consistent, and robust codebase, reflecting my commitment to high-quality software engineering practices.
